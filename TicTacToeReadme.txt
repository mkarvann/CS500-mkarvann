Tic Tact Toe Group Activity

Objective: To build a TicTacToe game that plays against an intelligent computer.
Requirements: Must use backtracking for the computerâ€™s logic. Must work in groups of 3-4.
1. Identify the primary functions necessary in TicTacToe (minimum of four).


2. What information does each function require in order to execute its task?


3. How will you store the board and track the moves? What is the most logical data structure


4. What is your approach? Would you put TicTacToe into a class? Justify your answer.


5. How will the computer decide where to go? Can you merely use a random number if the
computer is playing intelligently? Develop the logic (pseudocode) for this question.
